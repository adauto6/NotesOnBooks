# Reasons why I'm reading it ..
First Edition (1984) , Autor: T. R. Reid

The changelles we're facing in quantum computing resemble the same issues the semiconductor industries have nearly after the invention of transistors.

* As the became very clear in the first chapter, when the author titled at as "tyranny of the numbers", which was one the main problems of the semiconductor industry between 50 and 60s.
* On/Off devices to solve everything ??? So simple but the speed is the key !!!

* The main ideia of the transistor was to replace th vaccum tube because this device was being used to several electronic product, for instance, radio and television. However, these devices are large, waste a lot of energy, are hot and slow. Then, they need a new solution for overcome these problems.  

* Beside the transistor, Reid mentioned other interesting inventions such as, tecnetron, spacistor, nuvistor, thyristor and a new bio-inspired device, the neuristor.

* Tecnetron - It is a small rod of n-type germanium, 2 mm in length and 0.5 mm in diameter, provided with two contact electrodes at the ends. These must be of such material that they act solely like electrical conductors and not like transistor junctions (https://www.rfcafe.com/references/radio-electronics/tecnetron-competitor-transistor-may-1958-radio-electronics.htm). Teszner has utilized the cylindrical configuration, transforming a linear effect to a quadratic one by applying a radial electric field. The capacitance effect, with its reduction of impedance as frequency increases, is one of the reasons for the high transconductance at high frequencies
* Spacistor - The Spring transistor.

* Nuvistor - The Nuvistor is often regarded as a last desperate effort by valve manufacturers to stem the flow of 'transistorisation' which was becoming a torrent by this time (http://www.r-type.org/articles/art-150.htm).

* Thyristor - Recitfier and controlled current (controlled diode)

* Neuristor - They were even started to think about a kind of a device to mimic the brain which should be able to perform all the functions of the human neuron - making a artificial brain.
